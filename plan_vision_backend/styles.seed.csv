Modern Infinity,"['exterior_pool', 'exterior_backyard']","Design a Modern Infinity Pool. The water should appear flush with the deck (knife-edge or perimeter overflow) for a mirror-like effect. Use light-colored stone coping (limestone or travertine). Keep the surrounding deck uncluttered with sleek, modern loungers."
Tropical Lagoon,"['exterior_pool', 'exterior_backyard']","Create a Tropical Lagoon pool. Use a freeform, organic shape rather than a rectangle. Incorporate natural boulders and a waterfall feature. Use a darker plaster finish to make the water look deep and ocean-like. Surround with dense tropical landscaping."
Urban Lounge,"['exterior_rooftop', 'exterior_balcony', 'commercial_restaurant']","Design an Urban Rooftop Lounge. Focus on the view—use seamless glass railings. Create social zones with sectional seating and fire tables. Incorporate ambient lighting (string lights, lanterns) for evening use. Add a bar area for entertaining."
Cozy Bistro,"['exterior_balcony', 'exterior_patio']",Maximize this small Balcony with a Cozy Bistro style. Use space-saving furniture like a foldable metal bistro set. Cover concrete floors with interlocking wood deck tiles or an outdoor rug. Add verticality with railing planters and hanging pots to add greenery without losing floor space.
"Southern Charm
","['exterior_porch', 'exterior_facade']","Create a Southern Charm front porch. Furnish with classic white wooden rocking chairs or a porch swing. Hang Boston ferns between the columns. Paint the porch ceiling a soft 'haint blue'. The vibe should be welcoming, traditional, and slow-paced."
Restoration / Declutter,"['other', 'interior_empty', 'exterior_backyard']","Perform a General Restoration and Declutter. Identify any mess, garbage, or wear-and-tear in the image and remove it. Repair damaged surfaces (cracked walls, stained floors). Improve the lighting to be bright and natural. Do not significantly change the furniture style, just make the existing space look new and clean."
